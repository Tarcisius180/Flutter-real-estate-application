This is a final year group project where the coding was done by me and research about real esate and its workings were done by other members(4)

This is a flutter real estate application. The application will focus onntwo audiences real estate investors(property investors) and normal users who would be intersted in viewing properties. This application will simulate a real estate company which is Happy properties and the properties of which they have for sale and the property investment services which they provide (to the capacity of the application) to the users who have a property investment porfolio with them.

Normal users will be able to search and look through properties, make use of finacial calculators and make use of the map that will have the location of homes on the map.

The real estate investors, they will have the ability to view the properties in thier porfolio, see the profit and loss which the property they have brings, edit thier profile, view alerts from thier property managers, view thier favourite properties, view thier finacial report that they receive at the end of the month from the real estate company they work with and the other features that the normal users are able to make use of.
